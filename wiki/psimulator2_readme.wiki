= System requirements =

 * *Java Runtime Environment version 7+*
 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/

 * *Telnet client*
 You can use the built-in client but if you don't like it you can download putty (http://www.putty.org/) on Windows or just use telnet in case of linux/unix system.

 * *Connection to real network*
 This connection is possible only on unix systems. You must install the libpcap library (from repository), the jNetPcapLibrary (http://jnetpcap.com/download) and the virtual switch VDE (from repository). To run connection to real network see the "Real nework connection" section of this page. WARNING: This functionality is not yet completed.


= Instructions for installing psimulator2 = 

Download it from [http://code.google.com/p/psimulator/downloads/list downloads] section and unzip.


= Instructions for running psimulator2 =
Frontend contains manual Help -> Help, or just F1.

== Build network topology ==
To run psimulator you must at first build the network topology with simulator frontend (GUI) and save it to XML configuration file. Than you can run the simulator backend (simulation server) with the created XML configuration file.

== Run frontend ==
To run the the simulator frontend (GUI) type in the command line 
{{{
java -jar psimulator2_frontend.jar
}}}
 (with the correct path to the jar file).

== Run backend ==
To run the simulator backend (simulation server) type:
{{{
java -jar psimulator2_backend.jar path_to_the_config_file.xml
}}}
(with the correct path to the jar file). The program prints on startup telnet ports of all virtual network devices you can connect to (typically started on 11000 and the telnet port on which can be connected the frontend to listen simulator events (typically on 12000).

== Connect to virtual device ==
To connect to virtual network device type in linux command line: 
{{{
telnet localhost <port of the requested device>
}}}
 on windows use putty with telnet protocol and port of the requested device.

When frontend and backend are started and frontend is connected to backend (top left button - "Simulator" and then "Connect to server" localhost:12000) there is a possibility to connect to virtual device through fronted with right-click on device and "Open telnet".
