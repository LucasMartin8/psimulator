#summary Instructions for simulator initiation under linux (starting a server, connecting clients to server)

= Prerequisities =
 * installed needed parts (see SystemRequirements)
 * unpacked zip archive with simulator

= Server startup =
Start server in terminal with command:
{{{
./start_server <config> <port> -n
}}}
Where
 * *`<config>`* is XML file with network settings (routers, interfaces, )
 * *`<port>`* is number specifying from which port number will routers will be listening on. If not specified value 4000 is used.
 * *`-n`* is for loading only skelet of routers, interfaces, NAT, .. (completely without settings), *this is optional argument*

Sometimes there is handy to have some network device, which no one can change their configuration. Such routers are used for network structure.

After running script the server will write list of computers/routers with port numbers on which they listen

Server writes also some service information about what is going on in virtual network.

== Example ==
For starting server with empty configuration (just with skelet of network = cables between routers):
{{{
./start_server laborka.xml 3000 -n
}}}

For starting server with full configuration:
{{{
./start_server laborka.xml 3000 
}}}
